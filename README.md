# Hate-speech-Detection-using-Bert-Model

## Overview
This project implements  **BERT model** for classifying tweets into **Hate Speech, Offensive Language, or Neither** using a **Kaggle dataset**. We compare BERT's performance with traditional ML models.

## Models & Accuracy
- **Random Forest**: 89.29%
- **Decision Tree**: 87.11%
- **Logistic Regression**: 88.75%
- **SVM**: 88.42%
- **BERT (10 epochs)**: 86.36%

BERT's accuracy is slightly lower due to limited training epochs
